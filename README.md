# 17-Image-Classification
## **Overview**<br>
The images have large scale, pose, and light variations and there are also classes with large variations of images within the class and close similarity to other classes. The categories can be seen in the figure below. We randomly split the dataset into 3 different training, validation, and test sets. A subset of the images have been ground-labeled for segmentation. <br>
